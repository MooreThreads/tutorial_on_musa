This repository, hosted on GitHub, is designed as a comprehensive tutorial resource, aiming to provide developers with clear, step-by-step guidance on running large models on Moore Threads's hardware. It serves as a practical handbook, equipping developers with the necessary knowledge and techniques to seamlessly execute large-scale models within Moore Threads Company's specific hardware environment.

Key Features and Contents:
1.	Demonstrative Examples: The repository contains a rich collection of sample codes and executable scripts. These examples are meticulously crafted to showcase real-world scenarios, illustrating how to effectively load, configure, and run large models on A Company's hardware. By following these examples, developers can quickly grasp the key procedures and best practices, significantly reducing the learning curve and development time.
2.	Third-Party Open Source Model Integration: To enhance the practicality and versatility of the tutorial, we have incorporated certain third-party open source model codes in this repository only as demonstration examples solely. It's crucial to note that these third-party open source models are the intellectual property of their respective third-party rights holders.
